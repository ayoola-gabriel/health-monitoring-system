# health-monitoring-system

This project involves a wearable device that monitors a user's blood pressure and heart rate using the BPT Algorithm from Analog Devices. The device automatically updates the measurements to ThingSpeak when the battery level is above 90% or while it is charging. Additionally, the system sends SMS alerts to medical personnel or the user's next of kin if there is a significant abnormality in the user's blood pressure.

The primary objective of this project is to minimize the risk of death or injury caused by blood pressure-related issues by providing rapid response capabilities. Furthermore, it enables remote monitoring of the user's health status.
